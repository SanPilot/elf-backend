# Elf
### or, Epic Lab Form
Backend for Elf.

*by Hussain Khalil*

## Description
This repository contains the backend for Elf.

It requires a corresponding frontend to function properly.

Elf is a web-based application for submitting, viewing and processing lab requests.

You can find a project abstract at `meta/Lab Request Application - Project Abstract.pdf`.

## Documentation
Further documentation, can be found in `DOCS.md`.

## Notes
For security purposes, it is recommended to use a TLS (HTTPS)-enabled proxy facing the public to proxy API responses from the API. This will increase security by encrypting API requests and responses with HTTPS. A web proxy such as NGINX or Apache can be used to accomplish this.
